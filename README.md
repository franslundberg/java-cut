# java-cut

Java cut- and paste library. Functions (static methods) and classes that are 
independently reusable by code cut- and paste. Public domain.
Normally a class in this repo does not depend on any other classes.

No dependencies on external libraries.

Most code will work with Java 5, but some may require a newer JVM.

Enjoy! / Frans Lundberg
