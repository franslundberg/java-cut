# java-cut

Public domain, Java cut- and paste source code library. 
Functions (static methods) and classes that are independently reusable by code cut- and paste.
Normally a class in this repository does not depend on any other classes.

No dependencies on external libraries.

Most code will work with Java 5, but some may require a newer JVM.

Enjoy! / Frans Lundberg
