<h1>Package cut</h1>

<p>This is the main package of java-cut -- a public domain cut- and paste repository
of Java code.</p>

<p>Classes and sometimes individual functions (public static methods) are independently
reusable. Feel free to cut- and paste the code.</p>

<p>There are no releases of this repository since it is not meant to be used
as a single entity. The code may be changed without compatibility
with previous versions.</p>

<p>This package has well-tested code ready for production use.</p>
